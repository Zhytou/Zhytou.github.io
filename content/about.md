Hi, I'm **Zhytou(ZHONG Yang)**. I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in information engineering from  [Zhejiang University](https://webplus.zju.edu.cn/_s358/main.psp).

The attempt to work as a programmer first arose in my junior year. The main reason why I tried to look for new career opportunities in software engineering at that moment was the better prospect and salary compared with sticking to EE. I learned CS106l at the very beginning and put most of my efforts on Leetcode.

Luckily, I got an internship of being a back-end developer at [Meituan](https://about.meituan.com/en), which exposed me to the real-world scenarios of technology applications. Engaged in debugging and system optimization, I grew adept at leveraging Meituan’s technology stack and assimilating the Java coding standards. However, I found myself sick of the upset 996 lifestyle and uninterested in writing code closely related to business. Henceforth, I tried to presume further education in IT-related field.

These days, I have been focusing on respected foreign universities’ courses including MIT6.824 and CMU14-445(thanks to the self-learning [repo](https://csdiy.wiki/)). Also, I look forward to putting my acquisitions into practice and becoming part of the open-source community by joining GoSC or OSPP this summer.

With respect to my career goals, I desire to be an engineer in software and hardware development at leading IT companies in the short run, not merely creating and optimizing the function modules of main products and systems, but building things that excite me and impact people.
